Welcome! I am a Business Analyst and Data Scientist dedicated to transforming complex spatial and statistical data into actionable insights. I am currently engaged as a Research Volunteer at the [Cognitive Aging Lab](https://psychlabs.torontomu.ca/cal/), where I develop Python automation tools to optimize research workflows in active aging studies.

I hold a [Master's degree in Spatial Analysis from Toronto Metropolitan University](https://www.torontomu.ca/spatial-analysis/about/) and have completed specialized certificates in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from the University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo. My research, including a significant analysis of Loweâ€™s market exit in Canada and consumer health patterns in Toronto, has honed my skills in geospatial analysis, machine learning, and data modeling.

Professionally, I have contributed to several high-impact projects such as developing an urbanization index with PiinPoint and implementing real-time fraud detection systems. My work has consistently led to improvements in operational efficiencies and strategic decision-making in various business contexts.

As a director at GISource and an active contributor to [GISphere](https://gisphere.info/), I am deeply involved in advancing GIS education and application on a global scale, demonstrating my commitment to the broader community of geospatial and data sciences. My technical proficiency spans across a broad array of platforms including Python, R, and several GIS tools, equipping me with the versatility to tackle diverse analytical challenges.

I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover patterns and narratives that help understand and address real-world issues, particularly in business and environmental contexts.

Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my PhD in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
BA in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in the
*American Political Science Review*, *International Studies Quarterly*,
*Conflict Management and Peace Science*, and
*Political Science Research and Methods*, among other outlets. This
[research](research) explores the causes and consequences of political violence
using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial
analysis, and big data. I have [taught](teaching) quantitative methodology and
international relations, and am a certified instructor with
