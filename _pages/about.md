Welcome! I am a Business Analyst and Data Scientist dedicated to transforming complex spatial and statistical data into actionable insights. I am currently engaged as a Research Volunteer at the [Cognitive Aging Lab](https://psychlabs.torontomu.ca/cal/), where I develop Python automation tools to optimize research workflows in active aging studies.

I hold a Master's degree in Spatial Analysis and Bachelor's degree in Geographic Analysis from [Toronto Metropolitan University](https://www.torontomu.ca/spatial-analysis/about/), and have completed specialized certificates in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from the [University of Toronto](https://learn.utoronto.ca/programs-courses/certificates/artificial-intelligence) and the [University of Waterloo](https://watspeed.uwaterloo.ca/programs-and-courses/program-data-science.html#brochure). My research interests include: 1. Business/Retail Geography, 2. Geospatial data modeling, 3. Health and Crime Analysis.

As a director at GISource and an active contributor to [GISphere](https://gisphere.info/), I am deeply involved in advancing GIS education and application on a global scale. My technical proficiency spans across a broad array of platforms including Python, R, and several GIS tools, equipping me with the versatility to tackle diverse analytical challenges.

I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover patterns and narratives that help understand and address real-world issues, particularly in business and environmental contexts.
