Welcome! I am a Spatial Data Science Enthusiast dedicated to transforming complex spatial and statistical data into actionable insights. I am currently engaged as a Research Volunteer at the [Cognitive Aging Lab](https://psychlabs.torontomu.ca/cal/), I am developing Python tools to streamline workflows, enhancing our ability to analyze complex data effectively. In addition, in my role as director at GISource and as a contributor to [GISphere](https://gisphere.info/), I am committed to advancing GIS education and practical applications on a global scale.

I earned my Master's degree in Spatial Analysis and a Bachelor's degree in Geographic Analysis from [Toronto Metropolitan University](https://www.torontomu.ca/spatial-analysis/about/), complemented by specialized certificates in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from the [University of Toronto](https://learn.utoronto.ca/programs-courses/certificates/artificial-intelligence) and the [University of Waterloo](https://watspeed.uwaterloo.ca/programs-and-courses/program-data-science.html#brochure). My research interests span Business and Retail Geography, analyses pertaining to Health and Crime, and Machine Learning Modeling, where I explore the intersections of data and real-world applications. 

I have expertise in GIScience, data science and space-time modelling in addressing complex social science problems. My goal is to leverage data to reveal patterns that help us understand complex issues, always striving to make a meaningful impact through my work.
