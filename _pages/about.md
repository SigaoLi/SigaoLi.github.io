Welcome! I am a spatial data science enthusiast committed to transforming complex spatial and statistical data into actionable insights. Currently, I am a research volunteer at the [Cognitive Aging Lab](https://psychlabs.torontomu.ca/cal/), developing tools designed to streamline workflows and enhance analytical capabilities. In addition, as a contributor to [GISphere](https://gisphere.info/), I am actively involved in advancing GIS education and its practical applications worldwide.

I hold a Master’s degree in Spatial Analysis and a Bachelor’s degree in Geographic Analysis from [Toronto Metropolitan University](https://www.torontomu.ca/spatial-analysis/about/), enhanced by specialized certificates in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from the [University of Toronto](https://learn.utoronto.ca/programs-courses/certificates/artificial-intelligence) and the [University of Waterloo](https://watspeed.uwaterloo.ca/programs-and-courses/program-data-science.html#brochure). My [research interests](research) include Business and Retail Geography, Health and Crime Analysis, and Machine Learning Modelling. These areas allow me to explore the intersection of data and real-world challenges.

I aim to use my expertise in GIScience, data science, and space-time modelling to uncover patterns that enhance our understanding of intricate social science problems.
