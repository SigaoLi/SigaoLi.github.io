In this set of projects, I use advanced quanitative methods to tackle the problem of more accurately measuring concepts of interest in international relations. One uses Bayesian latent variable models to directly assess the strength of peace agreements in civil conflict rather than having to use agreement duration as a proxy for strength. Another harnesses advances in big data and develops new measures of economic interdependence and methods for detecting disruptions of regular economic exchange between states from a product-level trade dataset with over two billion observations.

## RAnalysis of Homicides by Type in the City of Toronto

![](/images/research/homicide.jpg)

> This paper explores the issue of homicide rates in the city of Toronto, Canada. In order to analyze homicide rates, a number of studies and hypotheses were created in order to seek out any possible patterns and influences that make homicides more common in certain areas of the city. Three hypotheses were used based on logic to narrow the focus down of this study. In order to accept or reject the hypotheses, a literature review based on various articles was conducted, and certain datasets were used to create multiple maps showing statistics of interest. This specific area of research is valuable to continue studying in the future because it may help pinpoint certain factors which relate to homicide rates, in which that information could be used to in turn slowly decrease the homicide rates in Toronto.

> This map poster focuses on how heat maps can help to reduce police response time, improve the efficiency of police patrols by detecting high-crime areas, and provide potential transportation infrastructure or regulation improvements by locating high accident-prone areas.
