Leveraging AI in environmental monitoring, I have developed projects such as a deep learning model for forest fire detection using satellite imagery, achieving over 97% accuracy. This project showcased the potential of integrating AI with natural science to predict and respond to environmental disasters effectively.

> This project develops a convolutional neural network model capable of detecting forest fires from satellite imagery. The model demonstrates robustness, showing high accuracy and low loss on validation and test data. This work contributes to the field of environmental monitoring and demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence in aiding disaster management and response initiatives.
