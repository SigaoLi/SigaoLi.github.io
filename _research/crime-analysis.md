My interest in crime mapping led to the development of a project titled "Hotspot Policing for the City of Toronto," which won the Presidentâ€™s Prize at the Canadian Cartographic Association Mapping Competition. Additionally, I analyzed homicide types in Toronto to provide actionable insights for crime prevention and resource management.

## Analysis of Homicides by Type in the City of Toronto

> This paper explores the issue of homicide rates in the city of Toronto, Canada. In order to analyze homicide rates, a number of studies and hypotheses were created in order to seek out any possible patterns and influences that make homicides more common in certain areas of the city. Three hypotheses were used based on logic to narrow the focus down of this study. In order to accept or reject the hypotheses, a literature review based on various articles was conducted, and certain datasets were used to create multiple maps showing statistics of interest. This specific area of research is valuable to continue studying in the future because it may help pinpoint certain factors which relate to homicide rates, in which that information could be used to in turn slowly decrease the homicide rates in Toronto.
