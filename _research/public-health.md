In health geography, I have applied spatial data analysis to understand the relationships between consumer behavior, health outcomes, and urban environment accessibility. Notably, I contributed to a research project examining the presence and magnitude of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem at various levels of geographic data aggregation in Ontario Health Central, aiming to optimize data utility for health services planning.



## Assessment of the presence and magnitude of Modifiable Areal Unit Problem atvarious levels of geographic data aggregation in Ontario Health Central

> This study used disease data provided by the OCHPP and census data from Statistics Canada to conduct Multivariate Regression Analysis and Predictive Analysis on 366 neighbourhoods in southern Ontario. The results indicate that significant predictors at different geographic levels are distinct, and that a model from a high aggregation level will not be able to accurately predict the dependent variable at a low aggregation level, but vice versa. Furthermore, as the levels of aggregation increase, there is only an increase in correlation between a few variables and others being weakened.
