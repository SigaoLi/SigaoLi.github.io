My research in business geography began with my undergraduate thesis, "The Impact of Population Distribution in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area on Ethnic Retail Location," which analyzed how demographic factors influence retail strategies. This continued with my Master's thesis on "Analyzing Lowe’s Failure in Canada from a Geographical Perspective," where I assessed how geographical insights could predict and explain business outcomes in retail.

My interest in crime mapping led to the development of a project titled "Hotspot Policing for the City of Toronto," which won the President’s Prize at the Canadian Cartographic Association Mapping Competition. This work aimed to designate priority areas for police resource allocation. Additionally, I analyzed homicide types in Toronto to provide actionable insights for crime prevention and resource management.

In health geography, I have applied spatial data analysis to understand the relationships between consumer behavior, health outcomes, and urban environment accessibility. Notably, I contributed to a research project examining the presence and magnitude of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem at various levels of geographic data aggregation in Ontario Health Central, aiming to optimize data utility for health services planning.


## Analyzing Lowe's Failure in Canada from A Geographical Perspective

![](/images/research/master_paper.png)

> This study examines the failure of American home improvement retailer Lowe's in Canada from a geographic perspective. It analyzes Lowe's operating strategy, financial performance, and store share, and uses an optimized market demand calculation formula and the Huff Model to simulate market demand and conduct trade area analysis. Results indicate an unequal distribution of the home improvement market in Canada, characterized by intense competition in certain provinces. Yet, opportunities for market entry and store optimization remain evident. Most Lowe's stores were developed in locations with low demand and high competition, compared to its main competitor The Home Depot. These findings may have contributed to helping understand why Lowe's exit from the Canadian market and provide valuable insights for international retailers on market entry and operations. The proposed formula may also improve the accuracy of retailers' consumer spending forecasts.

## Hotspot Policing for the City of Toronto

> This map poster focuses on how heat maps can help to reduce police response time, improve the efficiency of police patrols by detecting high-crime areas, and provide potential transportation infrastructure or regulation improvements by locating high accident-prone areas.

## Assessment of the presence and magnitude of Modifiable Areal Unit Problem atvarious levels of geographic data aggregation in Ontario Health Central

![](/images/research/maup.jpg)

> This report was prepared for the client, the Ontario Community Health Profiles Partnership (OCHPP) team at the MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions at St. Michael’s Hospital. The aim of this project was to assess the presence and magnitude of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), the problem of different spatial units yielding different results, at various levels of geographic data aggregation in Ontario Health Central. Recently, new “neighbourhood” boundary regions, the smallest spatial units available, were created in Toronto, and this will be expanded for other Ontario regions. In addition to neighbourhoods, there are multiple administrative regional boundaries in Ontario used in health research, such as various types of Census regions or provincial boundaries. It follows that health research in Ontario would also be impacted by the MAUP, but the extent of these effects tend to be overlooked and are largely unstudied in Ontario.

This study used disease data provided by the OCHPP and census data from Statistics Canada to conduct Multivariate Regression Analysis and Predictive Analysis on 366 neighbourhoods in southern Ontario. The results indicate that significant predictors at different geographic levels are distinct, and that a model from a high aggregation level will not be able to accurately predict the dependent variable at a low aggregation level, but vice versa. Furthermore, as the levels of aggregation increase, there is only an increase in correlation between a few variables and others being weakened.

Thus, this study provides support that the MAUP influences diabetes research when using different levels of geographic data aggregation. In this project’s findings, some variables do not remain significant at the CSD level. This was contradictory to typical findings in the literature seeing stronger correlations with higher data aggregation, but this finding is likely attributed to a small sample size and consequent lack of power in the CSD analyses. However, and fortunately for the sake of confidence in the diabetes literature, the overall correlations between the predictors and diabetes prevalence remained generally consistent. We further discuss limitations and recommendations to handle the MAUP.

## The Impact of Population Distribution in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area on Ethnic Retail Location

![](/images/research/bachelor_paper.png)

> Due to the importance of consumption in the urban economy, increasing consumer demand, and rising ethnic business activities, ethnic retail has become a topic of growing interest in the academic community. The article uses census and supermarket location data to examine the distribution of ethnic Chinese supermarkets in the Toronto CMA area. Utilize consumption data to estimate the sales potential. The Chinese ethnic supermarket's trade area was determined using the buffer zone and Thiessen Polygon. Additionally, this research analyzed the population characteristic within its trade area for specific cases. The study's findings indicate that (1) the Toronto CMA does have a geographical pattern of Chinese supermarkets moving to the suburbs; (2) Chinese communities continue to be the primary location consideration for some Chinese supermarket operators; and (3) a sizable proportion of companies has begun to shift to a new business model services South Asian population.

## RAnalysis of Homicides by Type in the City of Toronto

![](/images/research/homicide.png)

> This paper explores the issue of homicide rates in the city of Toronto, Canada. In order to analyze homicide rates, a number of studies and hypotheses were created in order to seek out any possible patterns and influences that make homicides more common in certain areas of the city. Three hypotheses were used based on logic to narrow the focus down of this study. In order to accept or reject the hypotheses, a literature review based on various articles was conducted, and certain datasets were used to create multiple maps showing statistics of interest. This specific area of research is valuable to continue studying in the future because it may help pinpoint certain factors which relate to homicide rates, in which that information could be used to in turn slowly decrease the homicide rates in Toronto.
