Leveraging AI in environmental monitoring, I have developed projects such as a deep learning model for forest fire detection using satellite imagery, achieving over 97% accuracy. This project showcased the potential of integrating AI with natural science to predict and respond to environmental disasters effectively.


## Genetic Algorithms for Portfolio Strategy Optimization
