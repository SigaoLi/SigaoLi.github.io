## Demand Forecasting for Commercial Truck Assembly

![](/images/research/truck.png)

> This project was designed to create a demand forecasting model for a top-tier global commercial truck and bus manufacturer that employs flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). FMS inherently blends Job-Shop and Mass Production methodologies, often leading to inventory inconsistencies and efficiency concerns. By analyzing historical data and tapping into previously overlooked variables, our chief aim was to anticipate future demand for crucial parts requirements for the truck & bus assembly process. Ultimately, we sought to offer data-driven recommendations for forward-thinking inventory management, streamlining costs and boosting operational efficiency.
